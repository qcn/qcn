Hello! I'm QC, a very normal human being and _definitely not a rabbit at all_, unless I actually _am_. How mysterious.

I own all the board games.

Things I care very deeply about: vim.

I'm forever trying to think of creative things to do with personal profiles, and this just adds one more to the list. Thanks, GitHub.

While I decide what to put here, you can try my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/priority_q), where I shill for vaccinations, passive-aggressively subtweet strangers (is there any other way to subtweet?), and retweet bunny pictures. Sometimes I [play violin too](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkVKV1oJbgKT9TYzD0bLQpw), I guess.
